								There is a pond covered with lily pads. The pond began with 1
								lily pad, but the patch doubles in size every day. On day 48 the
								entire pond is covered. How long would it take the lily ponds to
								cover exactly half the lake?
							</p>
							<p>
								Your first thought was probably 24. Most people see the word
								"half" and automatically divide 48 in half. Our brains take
								these mental shortcuts to arrive at answers more quickly. If you
								did not rush to judgment and took some time to deliberately
								analyze the situation, you would eventually arrive at the
								correct answer, 47.
							</p>
							<p>
								As this riddle demonstrates, critical thinking takes time and
								effort and is more than just "being smart." It is a deliberate,
								mental process of checking the quality of your own thoughts and
								information you receive before you accept it as true.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, critical thinking is just one of the many cognitive
								functions we use at work each day. Before we continue, do you
								know how critical thinking differs from strategic thinking,
								creative thinking and even problem solving?

								<h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
								<p>
									Critical thinking is the process of analyzing available facts,
									evidence, and arguments to reach a reasoned judgment about
									what is true or right.
								</p>
							</section>

							<p>
								We use critical thinking skills for more than solving riddles!
								As public servants, we work in an environment of ambiguity,
								rapid change, and high public scrutiny. From climate change and
								affordable housing to digital transformation and reconciliation
								with Indigenous peoples, our challenges demand rigorous,
								insightful and impartial judgment. Finding solutions to these
								problems requires critical thinking.
							</p>
							<p>
								Consider if any of these examples relate to the work you do in
								your current role:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Evaluate Evidence:</strong> Critical thinkers assess
									the source, reliability, and bias of data and research.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Manage Ambiguity:</strong> Critical thinkers make
									reasoned decisions even when data is incomplete or
									contradictory.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Combat Misinformation:</strong> Critical thinkers can
									distinguish objective facts from opinion or persuasive
									framing.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Challenge Assumptions:</strong> Critical thinkers
									identify and question the unstated beliefs that underpin a
									proposed course of action.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Assess Risk:</strong> Critical thinkers can
									objectively weigh the pros and cons and potential unintended
									consequences of various options.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Ensure Objectivity:</strong> Critical thinkers
									minimize the impact of personal or organizational biases on
									official advice.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>
								Even if you are not involved in solving complex policy problems
								like climate change, you probably judge ideas and information at
								work more often than you even realize.

							<p>
								Have you been asked to contribute your thoughts and ideas to a
								business process? Have you been asked to choose a suitable venue
								for a team event? Have you participated in a selection process
								for a new employee? Have you been asked to proofread a
								colleague's email or report before it gets read by a senior
								manager? Have you been asked to brainstorm ideas for how to
								improve a program or your team's service to clients? All of
								these tasks involve some degree of critical thinking.
							</p>
							<p>
								In other words, not all of us are solving global problems at
								work, but most of us are analyzing and judging information
								related to our projects and internal processes every day.
							</p>

							<h2>Reflection Activity</h2>
							<p>
								Let's look at an ordinary workplace example where a manager
								solicits feedback from two team leaders, Aaron and Soraiya:
							</p>
							<p>
								<img
									src="/content/enforced/12333-SB-Darla_McFarlane/image_20260113223437464.png"
									alt=""
									style="max-width: 100%"
								/>
							</p>

							<p>
								Like Soraiya and Aaron, we often have different views than our
								colleagues on a range of topics and issues. Critical thinking
								requires you to form your own beliefs rather than adopting the
								inherited opinions of those around you.
							</p>
							<section aria-label="Inherited Opinion">
								<h3>Inherited Opinion</h3>
								<p>
									An inherited opinion is when you adopt someone else's opinion
									as your own rather than forming your own judgment.
								</p>
							</section>

							<h2>What's Next?</h2>
							<p>
								Critical thinking requires the application of logic. We use our
								reasoning skills to determine whether or not we accept or reject
								information as true or right. Put another way -- if critical
								thinking were a physical task then logic is the tool used to
								complete the task, much like the relationship between a paint
								brush and the act of painting.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the next section, you will learn the fundamentals of logic
								you need to become a well-equipped critical thinker.
